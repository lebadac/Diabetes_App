# Diabetes Prediction Android App

This Android app allows users to predict the likelihood of having diabetes based on various health indicators. The app collects inputs such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, HbA1c levels, and other health factors, then uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Features

- **User-friendly Input Fields**: Users can input their age, BMI, HbA1c levels, blood glucose levels, and select options for hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, and gender.
- **Prediction**: Based on the input data, the app sends a request to the backend to predict whether the user has diabetes.
- **Results Display**: The prediction result is shown in a readable format, with color coding indicating whether the user is at risk of diabetes.
